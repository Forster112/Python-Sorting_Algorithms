# Python-Sorting_Algorithms
My implementation of the different sorting algorithms in python

| sort Algorithm | File | function | description |
| -------------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| Bubble sort | [bubble_sort.py](bubble_sort.py) | def bubblesort(arr): | repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order |
| Insertion sort | [insertion_sort.py](insertion_sort.py) | insertion_sort(lists) | builds the final sorted array one item at a time |
| Selection sort | [selection_sort.py](selection_sort.py) | def selection_sort(arr): * 2 | divides the list into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end |
| Quick sort | [quick_sort.py](quick_sort.py) | def quick_sort(arr): | An array is divided into subarrays by selecting a pivot element and each list sorted recursively |
